Personal Goals :star2:
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Contribute to Open Source
2. Write more blog posts
3. Get more confident with JavaScript
4. Make more small and cool throwaway things
5. Work less
6. Be kind
