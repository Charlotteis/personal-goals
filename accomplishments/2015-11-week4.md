### Week in Review

A good to start to the personal goals process. I did only start it halfway through the week though so I
didn't plan a lot. Just as well as the theme of the last week (and will be for subsequent weeks) was to
do/work less. So I've been doing the things I find fun (Fallout, TV, Learning ES6) rather than focus
on work. 

The best thing I did this week was to give my first proper talk. It was on
[Your First PR](http://twitter.com/yourfirstpr) and I did it in front of 67 colleagues at
[@mandsdigital](http://twitter.com/mandsdigital). I don't remember what happened but I was told it was good.
I have a lot of practicing to do, though.

I've scheduled a few more things to do for the following week and it looks like I've scheduled too much.
I'm not feeling the pressure to delive though (yet!).
