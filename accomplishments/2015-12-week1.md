### Week in Review

I did a lot of things! I've been updating a lot of Code of Conducts for random events: this is both good but also
annoying in the first place, people seem to appreciate it though. I've done 11/24 Pull Requests on Open Source repos
for 24pullrequests.com and also helped get browserapis.wtf ready for contributings for newcomers.

I attended the event I organised with [codebar](codebar.io) and [24pullrequests](24pullrequests.com).
I did a talk and I didn't die! I met a whole crowd of talented and amazing people that I'd like to see again.
I feel encouraged to keep working on Your First PR and am getting more confident about talking about it publically at events.

I met the awesome folk behind [Do what you love](dwyl.io) and [Founders and Coders](foundersandcoders.com) and joined the
DWYL GitHub organisation where I will learn a lot from them and also try to contribute if I can. I ALSO want to become
a codebar coach next year. (Do you see I am already giving myself too much to do in 2016?).
